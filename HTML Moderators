<h1>Hello Moderators!</h1>
<p> I hope you all eighther know how to code or wish to learn. If you know, great! If not you can choose to learn by an app or learn from me.
If you choose to learn from me, I will teach you in the server with videos and text. Eighther way I will quiz you on what you've learned. The
app is mainly text. There are no videos. There is only a guide at the top. I hope that whaterver you choose you will learn to code and
be able to help with prjects. I would like all of you to start with learning HTML. <img src= "https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=592504798&rlz=1CAUSZT_enUS1078&q=html&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj49eXx_J2DAxU1rokEHfJZCokQ0pQJegQIFRAB&biw=1366&bih=633&dpr=1&safe=active&ssui=on#imgrc=O2LAft90i-2uhM"</img>
